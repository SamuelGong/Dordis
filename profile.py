"""This is a trivial example of a gitrepo-based profile; The profile source code and other software, documentation, etc. are stored in in a publicly accessible GIT repository (say, github.com). When you instantiate this profile, the repository is cloned to all of the nodes in your experiment, to `/local/repository`. 

This particular profile is a simple example of using a single raw PC. It can be instantiated on any cluster; the node will boot the default operating system, which is typically a recent version of Ubuntu.

Instructions:
Wait for the profile instance to start, then click on the node in the topology and choose the `shell` menu item.
